# language-installer
Collection of **Python** scripts to stream-line the installation and setup process of common used programming languages for the different OS.
Everything is a work-in-progress and I will update it depending on my personal needs.

## How to use
Just run the Python script for the desired language

If you have any questions open a issue.

## Currently supported languages and OS
- Java (Oracle jdk 21.0.4) - Win11

### Todo/I would like to add
- Add support for Java version
- Maven
- SDK man (this would cancel the need for above points)
