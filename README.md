# language-installer
Collection of scripts to stream-line the installation and setup process of common used programming languages 

This project is a work-in-progress and I will update it depending on my personal needs.

## Currently supported languages
- Java

### Todo/I would like to add
- Add support for Java version
- SDK man (this would cancel the need to support selectable versions)
- Maven
